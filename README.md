First-**C**lass **Reg**ular Functors

by [Yufei Cai et al.][project]


#### Installation

1. Download and install [simple-build-tool][sbt].
2. Run `sbt` here. Make sure the computer is connected to the internet.
3. Type `compile` into the console to build everything.
   It will take 2--5 minutes the first time around.
4. Type `run` into the console to execute [main class][tyranny].
5. Type `test` into the console to screen for errors.


#### Navigation

There are various interesting usage examples in the [main folder][main].
[Banana][banana] is a good starting point for innocent people,
and [Tyranny][tyranny] is a good starting point for those who has
access to our unpublished manuscript in one way or another.

#### Plan

1. Upload a jar to some binary distribution service so that
   installation would not traumatize innocent people.
